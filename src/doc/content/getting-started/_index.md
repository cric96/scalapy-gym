The main aim of this facade consist in using the basic environment describe in [OpenAI Gym](http://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control).

Currently, there is no interesting in creating environment Scala side. The workflow idea is:
- develop your reinforcement learning in Scala,
- create a functional facade to interact with ScalaPy Gym
- test your algorithms in Open AI baselines and share your results!
